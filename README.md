A Scala 3 matrix library.

Matr is an attempt to bring together safety, flexibility and simplicity for computing with matrices. 

* Safety through typed shapes and immutable data
* Flexibility through loose coupling between interface, data and operations
* Simplicity through an easily accessible API and "batteries included" default implementations, both with zero dependencies

This project is currently in pre-release phase. If you are looking for a professional and mature tool for computing with matrices, you should definitely consider [Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze)!
